## Project Folders
*Biometric Foreniscs
Contacins a Simple Hybrid Biometric System calculator wrote in Microsoft Excel that will allow a tester to speed up the process of calculateing the "Failure to Enroll Rate" the "False Rejection Rate" and the "False Acceptance Rate" of a Hybrid Biometric system that uses FingerPrint recongition and Iris Recognition

*Counter-Terrorism in Steganography
Contains a short paper on the reasearch around Steganography while during the proceses of writing the paper I was able to locate a hidden terror recuriting video on a popular image board

*Group_Project
Contains a group paper on a Cyber Range Management Framework for Cyber Warfare Training, The idea was to build a system that could be used to manage mulitple cyberranges from one location that could be used for training. Turning the smaller systems into one Large system

*HashChain_Challenge
In this folder you can see the Scenario and python code to decrypt the hashchain. The idea was to use a known seed to decypt a "blockchain" HashChain. The theory behind this know the see and braking chain you can potetnialy generate your own hashes, in another form braking a crypto such as bitcoin would allow you to generate bitcoins at will

*Individual Project 
Here you will find the document regarding my Individual Project for my Higher Certifcate on the follow, it shows the proceses and build for a Automated Self-Managed Offensive Security Training Environment, that has the ability to rebuild itself upon dammage or downtime

*RSA_Cryptography_Challenges
Collections of challenges and scripts for braking and decyrpting RSA style encryption challenges, these scripts are all wrote in python and can be seen with the challenges

*SecureCommuncations
This is a collection of lab material and scripts for decrypting each lab which are all named and include the challenges and solutions, the code used for these are wrote in python

*ThreatModel
Here you will see the reports for the threat modeling that was done during my Applicaiton security module in univeristiy in 2019/2020 these where based on fictional mobile banking applicaitons
