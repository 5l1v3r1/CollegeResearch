# Counter-Terrorism in Steganography


In the Document Named the same as this file, there is an excerpt of a paper I worked on
in my Computer and Network forensics module of my Bacholores Degree in Cyber Security
and Digital Forensics.

The paper was given with a question "What Does a Digital Forensic inveistgator need to 
know about Steganopgraphy", A very tough topic to write about I decided to tackle this
from an angle of which I have knowledge Counter-Terrorism. 

In my paper I went into detail of how terrorist orgranisations are using Steganography
to transmit and hide active intelligence in everyday public conversations.

It contains a brief excerpt that is a summeriszation of an investigation I conducted
with the hopes of being able to uncover current steganography in use. During the 
inveistigation I was able to uncover possible communications on a popular
image board, the information uncovered was reported to the appropriate authorities
