# Whats This
Here is the Redacted document about the my 3rd year group project for my Univeristy Bachelor's Degree in CyberSecurity and Digital Forensics

# Summary
The idea was to build a system that could be used to manage mulitple cyberranges from one location that could be used for training of cyber warfare teams on a limited budget. an example of this would be if MIT set up a small cyber range and needed to a larger range for a security training event or a Capture The Flag event, They could ask other univerisities to pair up on the project. So lets say MIT contacted Harvard and agreed, they would connect both Cyber Ranges through the platform turning the system into one Large CyberRange instead of two smaller ones
